Trigonometry 1992/93
====================

_Finishing my upper secondary education in 1993, I choose to do the obligatory
 report, in maths on the topic of trigonometry. I implemented a small program
 in [GFA Basic] on my [Atari ST], to graphs to include in the paper._

The code is copied verbatim from a hard copy I found, going through some old
boxes.
