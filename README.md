Trigonometry 1992/93
====================

_Finishing my upper secondary education in 1993, I choose to do the obligatory
 report, in maths on the topic of trigonometry. I implemented a small program
 in [GFA Basic] on my [Atari ST], in order to draw graphs to include in the
 paper._

The code here is copied verbatim from a hard copy I found, going through some
old boxes.
